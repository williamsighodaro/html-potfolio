<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m a passionate fullstack web developer with a strong foundation in HTML,
  CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React, Node.js, and Express. I
  specialize in building responsive, user-centric web applications that are both
  visually appealing and functionally robust. My workflow bridges design and
  backend logic, ensuring seamless user experiences from database to browser.
</p>

<p>
  Over the years, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects—from landing pages and
  custom CMS platforms to RESTful APIs and real-time applications. I thrive in
  dynamic environments where I can architect scalable solutions, write clean,
  maintainable code, and continuously learn and adapt to new technologies. Git,
  Docker, and CI/CD pipelines are part of my daily development toolkit.
</p>

<p>
  I’m driven by a deep curiosity for problem-solving and a commitment to
  delivering high-quality digital products. Whether working solo or
  collaborating with a team, I bring creativity, precision, and a user-first
  mindset to every project. Let’s build something amazing together!
